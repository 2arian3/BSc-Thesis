# BSc-Thesis
This repository contains all of my bachelor's thesis documents titled ```Predictive Maintenance Using Vibration Analysis for Industrial IoT Enabled Equipment``` in computer engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology. 

## System's Components
* [Server](#Server)
* [Gateway](#Gateway)
* [Web](#Web)

## Server
We developed an API and analytical server for applying predictive maintenance to different equipment. Used FastAPI for providing the API server and exploited Python's AI modules and libraries for signal processing and model optimization. All the codes and documents are provided [here](https://github.com/mies47/Predictive-Maintenance-Server).
